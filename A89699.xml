            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the ca≈øe of divorce, when it was put to Chri≈øt by the Phari≈øees to know his opinions in it, he being neither Scribe nor Phari≈øee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. of no ≈øect nor faction, one that drive no de≈øigne but Gods; and that came to fulfill the law, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy it, ≈øends tho≈øe great doctors to Schoole, to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive end and in≈øtitution of marriage, as it came immediatly from God, in innocency, when, and where all things were very good, as he that will ta≈øte water purely mu≈øt doe it at the fountain. But they not ≈øatisfied with this ≈øolution by way of ju≈øtification, urge an old ≈øtatute Law of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> which by its antiquity, authority, and u≈øage might (as they thought) <hi>v.</hi> 7) plead right of pre≈øcription for that ma≈øculine priviledge of putting away their wives. But Chri≈øt tels them, that Plant never grew in innocency, God grafted no ≈øuch Sience in the ≈øtocke of created nature, it was a mu≈øhroome that grew out of nature corrupted. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> (≈øaies he) bacau≈øe of the hardne≈øs of your hearts, ≈øuffered you to put away your wives, <hi>but from the beginning it was not ≈øo,</hi> as who ≈øay. It was indeed a politique law of conce≈ø≈øion, but policy mu≈øt not annull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, neither rea≈øon of ≈øtate, not laws municipal mu≈øt cro≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Therefore I, who am come to enlighten your judgements, and reforme your manners <hi>(Go≈øpell-properties)</hi> tell you againe that whatever your lu≈øts and exorbitancies might occa≈øion <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to do, or enact, by way of connivance or permi≈ø≈øion, that does not ju≈øtifie the practi≈øe (though never ≈øo old, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received) to be lawful, but rather ≈øhew it to be unlawful,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161641:3"/>
becau≈øe that permi≈ø≈øion varies from the fir≈øt po≈øition or ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard given by God him≈øelf, the prime legi≈ølator, whither this ca≈øe if rightly ≈øtated and argued mu≈øt be reduced for ≈øolution, no authority binding above his, nor no law again≈øt his, though ≈øeemingly never ≈øo ≈øpecious.</p>

It is true that Government (as marriage) is of God, but it is as true that governors (as per≈øons marrying) are of men, and that the great Intere≈øt (which word is now the onely I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol that men ≈øal down and wor≈øhip) of both Government and Governours is the glory of God, and the good of mankind: The end of the in≈øtitution is the onely intere≈øt of the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted, and con≈øequently the Mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In this age of ours, Kings plead for prerogative, flowres of the Crown, and right of Soveraignty, as they and their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers cal it. And even Parliament-priviledge is made u≈øe of by prerogative members, for promoting the arbitrary intere≈øt of the Crown; thus is authority wire-drawn, as if Governours rather then the Governed, were the end of Government, and Government it ≈øelfe is rather made a per≈øonall Intere≈øt, then a publique utility. Yea, Laws, nay Oathes, are thus made u≈øe of to captive &amp; in≈ønare men, by prerogative glo≈ø≈øes, as if it wer in the power of men, who are the ≈øons of rea≈øon to ≈øwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves into bea≈øts, and to abjure their very nature, and that by vertue of an ordinance of God, which Government is. What confidence can Kings have in people by ≈øuch ties as being <hi>ex natura rei</hi> unlawfull, do untie them≈øelves, and which are both unlawful to be taken, and when taken unlawfull to be kept. Such glo≈ø≈øes as Court Para≈øites, put upon lawes allegiance tending to make Kings ab≈øolute, and their power as well ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161641:3"/>
as po≈øitive, and their duty meere matters of plea≈øure, and acts of will, in the way neither to render Kings ≈øafe, nor their people happy.</p>
            <p>The Popery of an implicit faith and blinde obedience, will not, cannot la≈øt alwayes; which becau≈øe it is ≈øo much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by Epi≈øcopacy (that rag of Rome) therefore thence is that maxim. No Bi≈øhops, no King, implying that when ever the vail of ignorance and blind obedience was done away by aboli≈øhing of Bi≈øhops, and the peoples eyes were opened by divinity, and rea≈øon to ≈øee them≈øelves mi≈ø-led by pretence of authority from a right under≈øtanding of the nature of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will never endure to be ≈ølaves in≈øtead of freemen, ≈øubjects to governours in≈øtead of government, and to ≈øerve their intere≈øts who are their Mini≈øters and Gods meerly for their good, having their being (in office and authority) by, for, nor to no other end or purpo≈øe. For as the Pope is afraid of nothing ≈øo much as the tran≈ølating the word into popular languages for fear of betraying his jugling tricks in divinity, ≈øo nor Kings and Royalli≈øts then that the Lawes of the Land ≈øhould be Engli≈øh'd, I meane not ≈øo much in language, as in ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon (though there is no good rea≈øon why Engli≈øh eyes ≈øhould look through French ≈øpectacles, except it be to ≈øee to lo≈øe our way to liberty and property as they have done) but for Engli≈øh Lawes to ≈øpeake Prerogative, is wor≈øe then to ≈øpeake French, ≈øome Commentators are better Courtiers then Lawyers, who ≈øhould be men of rea≈øon, and not ≈øo di≈øcredit the Law (the honour of their profe≈ø≈øion) as to force it again≈øt rea≈øon to advance the will of a man above the rea≈øon of a State, and the originall end of government it ≈øelfe. Therefore its time to be no longer fool'd with State tearmes of <hi>Intere≈øt, Jewels, and Flowers of the Crowne,</hi> or the old over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne word of <hi>Prerogative,</hi> for what is this but fir≈øt to ≈øet up a golden image, and then to fall downe and wor≈øhip it. I am not again≈øt Kings nor their Crownes, its the abu≈øe, and onely

that that I abominate, which hath as much blindfolded the people of Chri≈øtendome, as the Popes ≈øupremacy hath the Princes thereof, who≈øe eyes yet ≈øhall be opened to ≈øee their errour, and to withdraw their necks out of his Eccle≈øia≈øticall yoake, and ≈øo its hoped ≈øhall the peoples (≈øpecially Engli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) in things Civil; to know, as their obedience to authority, ≈øo good authority in rea≈øon, ju≈øtice, and equity, for that their obedience; for ≈øo men act like men, el≈øe like bea≈øts, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ≈øubjected to will, which yet is not the lea≈øt part of that bondage of corruption the creation groans and travels in pain under, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20, 21, 22. being unwillingly made ≈øubject to that vanity, in hope and earne≈øt expectation to be delivered: and ≈øhal we be ≈øo vaine, ≈øpecially when a price is new put into our hands, as willingly to take up that yoake which the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though ≈øen≈øele≈ø≈øe and irrationall, unwillingly beares, in hope of being infranchi≈øed of it at the la≈øt, accounting even annihilation better then ≈øubordination to the inordinate will of falne mankinde. Old errours are ≈øo much cryed up under new lights, as that old truths will ≈øcarce be believed again≈øt cu≈øtome in errour: Kings they will not, but tell you its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt their intere≈øt not to be arbitrary, and the people they dare not believe it if the Princes doe not, though neither to 'ne nor to 'ther, but mu≈øt needs grant that <hi>ab initio non fuit ≈øic,</hi> its con≈øonant neither to the nature, nor the end of government; and con≈øequently not of Sovereignty, which onely ≈øo farre is <hi>≈øovereigne</hi> as it is <hi>pre≈øervative.</hi> Therefore the Law ≈øayes (of al men) the King can doe no wrong, hath le≈ø≈øe power to doe wrong, becau≈øe greater obligation to doe right then any man el≈øe; nay he is ≈øo far from having power to doe wrong, that he is neither to doe it, nor ≈øuffer it to be done by any inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our powers, but to ≈øee that ju≈øtice and protection according to Law be admini≈øtred to all by the Mini≈øters thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee's the chiefe.</p>
            <p>But the nature, of man even in innocency (though not by it)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161641:4"/>
lu≈øteth after an exorbitant ≈øuperiority, for when God had made him Lord over all but the forbidden fruit, hee thought him≈øelfe no King over the creature whil≈øt the Creator limited his power, though but in one, and therefore he re≈øolves either to win the hor≈øe, or lo≈øe the ≈øaddle, gaine that, or lo≈øe all. So Kings, bee their power never ≈øo great <hi>to doe,</hi> yet except they may al≈øo have power <hi>to undoe,</hi> negative as well as po≈øitive, power to deny, as well as to grant, and undoe as well as doe, they are un≈øatisfied, and ≈øticke not in effect to affirme, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you grant them <hi>Tyranny,</hi> you oppo≈øe <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Wherein yet they doe them≈øelves no right, nor tho≈øe that flatter them into ≈øuch principles: for when people ≈øee they cannot grant ≈øafe and lawfull premi≈øes, but with hazzard of ≈øophi≈øtical and prevaricate conclu≈øions to bee inferred thereupon, it makes them fearefull to grant any thing, le≈øt they lo≈øe all, an Inch gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, makes an Ell taken. As if commi≈ø≈øions, &amp;c. for honour-≈øake goe in the Kings name, then the Court con≈øequence is, they are the act, not his Laws; then the next re≈øult is, they are <hi>ad placitum,</hi> and not <hi>quamdiu bene ≈øe ge≈ø≈øerint,</hi> Prerogative is ≈øo procreant that no wombe is barren to the third or fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but every inference is productive of another. So let him have the honour to confirme and a≈ø≈øert Laws; then the next remove is, you mu≈øt allow him the u≈øe of his rea≈øon, and the next to that, therefore a negative as well as an affirmative voice: grant-freewill, and falling from Grace will follow. Suppo≈øe him the fountaine of honour; then, he retorts, I may conferre it on whom I plea≈øe, and for what cau≈øe, for vice as well as vertue. I may make <hi>George Villiers</hi> and his vertuous mother, Duke and Counte≈ø≈øe of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and court-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions Privy-councellours, nay aliens of the Scotch Nation, (who≈øe native ≈øtate intere≈øt by vicinity, is again≈øt ours) Peers and Parliamentmen in England.

No inferior authority hath a negative power to ≈øu≈øpend ju≈øtice or protection ≈øo farre as he is to admini≈øter it by his place, the King him≈øelf can derive no ≈øuch power to any, and if he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it, then he hath it not inherent in him≈øelf, for the Soveraignes power is principally to impower others. <hi>Magis</hi> and <hi>Minus</hi> make no e≈ø≈øentiall difference; Betwixt the King and a Con≈øtable there is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of power in point of proportion, but not in <hi>≈øpecie</hi> or kind, it is of the ≈øame kinde, and to the ≈øelf-≈øame end, one hath not power for, and the other again≈øt.

Thus</hi> Traquier <hi>him≈øelf is become a Covenanter: Such game≈øters will never lo≈øe, what game ≈øoever they play at, that can play fa≈øt and loo≈øe, and make any thing of every thing; and from the words,</hi> mutuall advice and con≈øent <hi>mentioned in the eigth Article of the</hi> Treaty <hi>intitle them≈øelves to a joynt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt. and us to breach of Covenant and Treaty; whereas tho≈øe words imply on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus much, that as the war was managed by a joynt ingagement again≈øt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy to both Nations, ≈øo that it ≈øhould not be ended by a peace tran≈øacted or treated by one Nation alone, without the privity and con≈øent of the other, that ≈øo neither of their intere≈øts might be damnified. Not that both of them ≈øhould be confounded. The rare contradictions that their Papers, and Practi≈øes hold forth; ≈øometimes the King mu≈øt not come to</hi> London <hi>till he have given ≈øecurity and ≈øatisfaction, then again be mu≈øt come without either; ≈øometimes propo≈øitions and no per≈øonall treaty, othertimes a per≈øonall treaty and no propo≈øitions; which now are impo≈øitions; ≈øometimes the King mu≈øt take the Covenant, otherwhile if be come not to the length of our de≈øires, in ≈øo doing, we mu≈øt be content; ≈øometimes they tell the King upon his refu≈øing the Propo≈øitions both Kingdomes will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained (for their mutuall ≈øafety) to agree and ≈øettle Religion and Peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; and then upon turne of the tide they tell us we mu≈øt wait till God change his heart: For the ≈øafety of the Kingdome the Army mu≈øt be Disbanded, and the King inve≈øted in the Militia, or it in him. Sure</hi> Janus <hi>is</hi> Propitious <hi>to the≈øe ambidexers, el≈øe they could never ≈øo bewitch wi≈øe men as well as fools with their Sorceries as they doe, and with the Preshyterian</hi> Eele-hooke <hi>draw the City and A≈ø≈øembly after them, and that not onely in</hi> England, <hi>but in</hi> Scotland <hi>al≈øo, where (they ≈øay) they have deluded the well-meaning Clergy, who are con≈øented to joyn with tho≈øe Covenant-breakers in a warre again≈øt us, provided it be for Covenant-breaking. The little good that we have got, by the great c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills that we have undergon, God ju≈øtly may, and it may be will puni≈øh us for it, but they for their di≈ø≈øembling ≈øhal not ≈øcape, hypocri≈øie and fal≈øehood is as hateful to God as to man.
